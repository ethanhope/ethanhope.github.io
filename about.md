Hello!

### More Information

Born and raised in San Diego, I love going to the beach and spending time in the sun. Not to mention, I have a huge interest in improving my physical capabilities and learning more about the physiologically processes of my body at the gym. Whether it be new diets or workout routines, I am always interested in trying/learning about new methods to improve myself. If you are interested in learning more about working out or just trying to lift with someone, please contact me!
